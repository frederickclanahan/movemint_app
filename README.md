# MoveMint — World-Class Refactor (July 18, 2025)

**MoveMint** is a first-class gig-driving companion built for speed, clarity, and empowerment.  
This refactored version represents a focused, production-ready reset — a clean foundation for smart, scalable growth.

---

### 🚀 Purpose

MoveMint was created to serve the people powering the gig economy — independent drivers.  
We believe they deserve tools that work as hard and as smart as they do.

This version delivers:
- A refined architecture for performance and flexibility
- A smoother experience for future contributors
- A launchpad for premium features in future phases

---

### 🧠 Philosophy

> **“Built First Class. Always.”**

MoveMint stands for design excellence, ethical tech, and practical empowerment.  
Every feature begins with the driver in mind — not just functionally, but emotionally and financially.

We build:
- With clarity, not clutter  
- With empathy, not exploitation  
- With precision, not patchwork
