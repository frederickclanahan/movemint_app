# 🎨 MoveMint Design Guidelines

## ✨ Our Visual Identity

MoveMint isn’t just an app — it’s a *first-class experience*. We exist to restore dignity, power, and momentum to the modern independent driver. Every visual choice should reflect that.

- **Clean** – Simplicity and clarity are king. No clutter, no chaos.

## 🔤 Typography

| Type             | Font               | Weight       | Notes                          |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| Headlines        | SF Pro / Inter     | Semi-Bold    | Size varies by platform        |
| Body Text        | SF Pro / Inter     | Regular      | 15–16pt for mobile readability |
| Labels/Buttons   | SF Pro / Inter     | Medium       | All-caps optional              |

**Avoid font overload. One clean font family is enough.**

---

## 🧱 Layout & Spacing

- **Grid System:** 8pt baseline grid. Stick to it.
- **Padding:** Minimum 16pt around all containers
- **Card Corners:** Rounded (12–16pt). Elevate with soft shadows.
- **Tile Layouts:** Use elevation and spacing to create natural groups

---

## 🌘 Dark Mode

MoveMintDarkTheme is our base. It should feel:

- **Soft, not harsh**
- **Readable at a glance**
- **Elegant, never depressing**

Respect system settings. Users should feel at home instantly.

---

## 🚫 UX Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- No hamburger menus
- No modal overload
- No unnecessary onboarding walls
- No cluttered dashboards or overlapping stats

Every screen should answer:  
**“What does the driver need right now to make a better decision?”**

---

## 🧠 Micro-Interactions & Animations

- Use motion sparingly to add polish (e.g., tile expand, shift log entry confirmation)
- Transitions should be fast (150–200ms) and purposeful
- Avoid anything that distracts from real-world driving conditions

---

## 🧩 Components

We lean on a core set of reusable components:

- DashboardTile  
- EarningsCard  
- WeatherTrafficBar  
- ShiftSummaryBlock  
- CalloutBanner (for alerts)

All components should be modular, responsive, and theme-aware.

---

## 🔒 Trust & Clarity

Design with integrity. No data harvesting, no hidden settings. MoveMint is built on **transparency and old-school trust**. Let the visuals reflect that.

---

## ✅ Final Word

Every pixel is a message.  
Every color is a signal.  
Every interaction is a promise.

MoveMint is world-class.  
**Design like it.**
