# 🚀 Features – Phase 1 Build (MVP)

Welcome to the first build phase of MoveMint: the world-class smart assistant for independent drivers. This isn't a demo. This is our first sprint toward something legendary.

---

## 🔑 Mission-Critical Goal

**Empower drivers with a beautifully designed, ultra-efficient app that delivers insights, clarity, and motivation — starting with shift summaries, earnings visibility, and traffic/weather awareness.**

---

## 🥇 Core MVP Features

Each feature below is essential. Nothing extra. No fluff.

---

### 1. 🧾 Shift Logging Screen  
- Manual entry of shift start, end, miles, and notes  
- Voice-to-text support (if feasible)  
- Stored locally or in Firebase  
- Pre-fill suggestions based on past entries (v2+)

**Purpose:** Gives drivers agency and a trackable starting point for earnings.

---

### 2. 📊 Shift Summary Screen  
- Simple, elegant report of hours worked, pay received, miles driven  
- Traffic/weather overlay if available  
- Visual highlights (best day, top earnings, miles-to-pay ratio)

**Purpose:** Drivers crave *clarity* — this is where they see the results of their hustle.

---

### 3. 🧭 Dashboard (Driver Command Center)  
- Daily snapshot view (earnings today, this week)  
- Animated tiles (show/hide based on time of day, user habits)  
- Weather & traffic integration  
- Quick launch to Shift Entry or Summary

**Purpose:** Replace guesswork with momentum. Start the day with data.

---

### 4. 🌘 Dark/Light Mode Toggle  
- MoveMintDarkTheme (already in themes.dart) fully implemented  
- Respect system-level settings by default

**Purpose:** Visual elegance. Makes it feel “Apple-polished.”

---

### 5. 🧱 Bottom Navigation  
- Home (Dashboard)  
- Add Shift  
- Summary  
- Settings

**Purpose:** Simple, always-available navigation. No friction, no confusion.

---

## 🔄 Backend & Architecture (Foundational Layer)

- Firebase Auth (email only)  
- Firebase Firestore (shift data, driver profile)  
- Provider or Riverpod for state management  
- Modular structure: `features/`, `services/`, `components/`

---

## 🔍 Future-Proofing Considerations

- Use enums & constants for screen routes, theme tokens  
- Plan data model as if analytics/export will be needed later  
- Isolate services (weather, traffic) for clean integrations

---

## 💡 What We’re NOT Doing (Yet)

- No payments or payouts  
- No scheduling or dispatch  
- No over-engineering  
- No design debt

This MVP is our *clean, lightning-fast core*. Anything that doesn’t serve that goal gets cut or parked.

---

## 🏁 Final Notes

This is MoveMint’s launchpad. The foundation of something that will change lives — not with noise or gimmicks, but with real tools, real dignity, and design that respects the driver’s time.

We’re building with precision. We’re launching with confidence.

Let’s move.
