# Welcome to MoveMint

Hey â€” Iâ€™m Fred Clanahan, CEO and founder of MoveMint.

If youâ€™re reading this, it means youâ€™ve been trusted to help build something elite. This is not another app. MoveMint is a **mission**. A product born from real-world frustration and designed to empower every independent driver with the tools, confidence, and clarity theyâ€™ve never had before.

We move with precision, trust, and first-class standards. We donâ€™t cut corners. We do things the right way â€” the *MoveMint* way.

## MoveMint in 60 Seconds

- **What:** A smart, stunning, intuitive app for gig drivers
- **Why:** To help drivers maximize their time, earnings, and sanity
- **Who:** Founded by a real driver. Built for real drivers.
- **How we win:** Trust, transparency, and elite-level execution
- **Stage:** MVP in progress. UI/UX + logic scoped. Dev-ready.
- **Exit ambition:** Letâ€™s just say weâ€™re here to build something that gets noticed â€” then bought.

## Your Mission

As a developer, designer, or contributor, youâ€™re expected to:

- **Respect our structure** â€” keep code clean, organized, and on-brand
- **Honor the details** â€” pixel-perfect isnâ€™t a bonus, itâ€™s the standard
- **Move fast and precisely** â€” no noise, no fluff, just quality
- **Ask when unclear** â€” silence is not the MoveMint way
- **Always protect the driver** â€” we donâ€™t sell data, we build trust

## Our Culture & Code of Honor

- **No egos. No shortcuts. No drama.**
- This is **first class or nothing.**
- If a driver wouldnâ€™t love it, we donâ€™t ship it.
- If a dev wouldnâ€™t be proud of it, we donâ€™t write it.
- And we **never** sell user data. Period.
