Developer Addendum: Driver Insights

Overview

This document bridges real-world driving insights with development priorities for MoveMint. It distills firsthand experience into actionable product context — not just for features, but for why we’re building them.

Behavioral Patterns That Matter

🚫 Orders to Avoid

Low pay, high mileage: Orders offering $3–$4 for 9+ miles are unacceptable.

Repeat offenders: Some restaurants consistently generate poor offers (e.g., low tip, long wait). Examples include places like Happy Pho — not to single out brands, but to build logic around repeated inefficiency.

Dev Takeaway: Build logic to flag and deprioritize offers with bad ROI. This can evolve into driver coaching or auto-decline suggestions.

🌐 Hot Zones vs. Cold Zones

High-density zones like Totem Lake (clustered restaurants, apartments, busy intersections) yield more frequent, higher-paying orders.

Low-density strips like Bel-Red (long blocks, less foot traffic) often yield slower activity, lower ROI, and more downtime.

Dev Takeaway: Use these patterns to help inform hotspot heatmaps, dynamic recommendations, or zone-based UI behavior.

⏰ Time of Day Trends

Lunch surge tends to peak between 11:30 AM and 1:00 PM.

Dinner ramps around 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM.

Late-night activity is more sparse but can spike near fast food hubs.

Dev Takeaway: Let UI adapt with time-based nudges — reminders to take breaks, bonus tips, or mood-shifted visuals.

🌧️ Weather Impact

Rain increases order volume but can decrease delivery times and app usage comfort.

App experience needs to adapt (larger fonts, more contrast, less screen tapping).

Dev Takeaway: Future enhancements can detect bad weather and modify the UI to reduce touch interactions and cognitive load.

🚘 Ergonomics and Setup

Many drivers use one hand while the other is on the wheel.

Thumb-friendly tap zones, minimal swiping, and clean layout reduce distraction.

Dev Takeaway: Prioritize speed-of-use and non-distracting UI. Every second saved matters to drivers.

Data That Drives Decisions

All insights above are backed by real-world logs and driving data (see included Excel sheets).

This is not hypothetical — it’s field-tested intelligence.

Every decision should trace back to driver empowerment and earning optimization.

Final Word

You're building for a movement — for independent earners who deserve tools that work as hard as they do. We're not here to build just another gig app.

We’re here to build the one that drivers brag about.

Let’s build it right.
